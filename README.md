# Analyzing Car Expenses

## Aim
How expensive is it to own a car, really? Here's my attempt at figuring out the true cost of owning our car.

## What's the data?
I've saved physical receipts and relevant bank transaction receipts related to the car since the day we got a car.

The data includes everything from the down payment, insurance costs, service fees, fuel (price and volume in liters), parking fees and fines. The notebook goes more in-depth on parking and fuel, because they have the most detailed information. 

** I didn't upload the underlying data in Excel, but the relevant summary statistics are in the notebook

## Suggestions?
Raise an issue with suggestions of interesting things to explore given the available data!
